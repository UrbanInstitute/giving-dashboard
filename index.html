        <p class="note_block"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> When uploading data into this feature on November 29, 2022, we corrected some errors in our April 2022 version. Please see the About the Data section below for more information.</p>
      
        <p class="general">Americans' giving patterns have always been in a state of flux, reflecting new social, economic, cultural, and technological trends.</p>

        <p class="general">Although certain elements of charitable giving have remained remarkably stable over the past half century—giving to 501(c)(3) charities as a proportion of individual disposable income has stayed near 2 percent for 40 years, for instance—the landscape continues to transform. Donor-advised funds, online crowdfunding, and digital giving, for example, have emerged and become more prominent in recent decades, reshaping giving and the ways researchers define, track, and measure it.</p>

        <p class="general"><span>Below, we have collected and organized data into a giving dashboard that provides a snapshot of the many ways Americans give.</span> We define giving expansively to include not only donations to tax-exempt nonprofits, but also crowdfunding, impact investing, and more. Many of our categories contain several measures from a range of data sources. On the right side of the dashboard, we provide a quick overview of each category by highlighting how the first measure in the category changed during the latest year for which data are available. By clicking on the category, you can explore all the measures within it. Although many types of giving resist quantification, the figures in this dashboard represent indicators that illuminate the dominant trends shaping the contemporary giving landscape in the United States.</p>

        <h4>About the Data</h4>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Corrections:</span> When preparing to update the dashboard in November 2022, we discovered that some of our indicators were displaying incorrect or inconsistent data. 
          <ul>
            <li>For “Total annual value of noncash charitable contributions” and “Total US online donations made on GivingTuesday,” we mislabeled the unit type. We have changed the former from “millions of dollars ($)” to “billions of dollars ($)” and the latter from “dollar value of donations” to “number of donations.” </li>
            <li>For “Total hours volunteered,” we transposed two numbers for the 2015 data point. We have corrected 8.42987 billion to 8.49287 billion. </li>
            <li>For “Money donated to ActBlue,” we rounded two data points incorrectly (we have corrected 2019 from $1.05 billion to $1.06 billion, and 2020 from $4.02 billion to $4.03 billion). For “Share of Americans who reported donating money to a charitable organization in the last 12 months,” we rounded one data point incorrectly (we have corrected 2008 from 83 percent to 82 percent), and we have removed a data point (56 percent for the year 2014) not included in the source.</li>
            <li>Lastly, we removed the “Aggregate charitable contributions from workplace giving programs” indicator because it is not clear that the study will be repeated and we found the source reported its data inconsistently across publications. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p> Additionally, when preparing to update the dashboard in March 2023, we made changes to two indicators for clarity.
          <ul>
            <li>For “Total number of donors that gave over $200 to a political campaign” and “Total money contributed to political campaigns via donations over $200,” we added the word “federal” to the chart titles. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> During our May 2025 update, we removed the “Mutual Aid” section because the source providing data for the only indicator, “Number of donations made to mutual aid networks through the ioby crowdfunding platform,” closed in 2024.
        </p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Methodology:</span> This dashboard synthesizes the most comprehensive, significant, and recent data available on giving from leading nonprofit researchers, practitioners and service providers, and some governmental sources. We conducted a landscape scan of giving data in the field and selected our indicators based on four core criteria: analytic rigor, salience, timeliness, and longitudinal availability.</p>

        <p>For more information on our data sources, select an indicator to find a short summary of how it was calculated. For more detailed methodological information, you can click on the indicator’s original source to dive deeper into the data.</p>
